# font-to-scratch-costumes
A simple tool to create a Scratch sprite of costumes of characters from a font file, along with their kerning values. Perfect for creating text engines.

The kerning information is stored as an "n by n" dimensional list where each row is the index of the previous character and each column is the index of the current character.
